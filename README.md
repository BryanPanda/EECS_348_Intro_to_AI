# Introduction
Lab1: Implemented BFS, DFS and A* search algorithms to find a path reach a destination from a start location.

Lab2: Implemented Minimax and AlphaBeta players to play Konane (also known as Hawaiian Checkers).

Lab3: Extended a knowledge base (KB) and an inference engine. The knowledge base supports three main interfaces: Assert, Retract, and Ask.

Lab4: Defined a domain for solving given problems. The domain and the problems are defined using Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL).

Lab5: Implemented a Na√Øve Bayes Classifier that analyzes the sentiment conveyed in text. When given a selection of text as input, the system will classify the text as positive or negative.
